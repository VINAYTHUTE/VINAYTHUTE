Ever since I was in High school, Hardware/software development has always fascinated me. This passion carried me through my education at Government College Engineering,Aurangabad (GECA). Getting into a reputed college like GECA provided an excellent platform for developing the right technical skills and presented me with an abundance of opportunities. Along the way, my love and interest in technology also deepened. I got the chance to realize my current potential and expand the horizon of my skills, pushing the limits farther.

I learned C,tearing through many online tutorials I could find on anything related to software development. I was insatiable. I studied new languages like C,C++,Python,got to learn about Electronics & Communications , and pursuing my interest for Electronics , I dived deeper into the field of Embbedded systems and PCB Designing, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. With the guidance of our faculty and seniors, I did internships and made projects for various industries technology, which taught me that blockchain technology has the power to bring revolution in the world. It was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

My interests include Competitive Programming which taught me patience and improved my Logical thinking and Problem-Solving skills to a great extent. My greatest achievement in Competitive programming has been a Global Rank - 14 among 4000+ participants in a monthly 3-hour coding contest at Codechef. Also, I love Writing on Quora.

Being a Computer science Student with 9.73 CGPA, I am also an Active Executive Body Member at PEC ACM Student Chapter, Technical Organising Committee(OC) member at PEC and Competitive Programming Lead at Codechef Campus Chapter, which certainly made me appreciate to work as a team towards the development of an organization or society.

There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
